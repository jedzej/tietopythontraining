## Tieto Basic Python Training

### Introduction

Welcome to the training repository! We will publish course materials
and track all the progress here. We are only tutoring people from Tieto,
but the materials are free to use.

We will introduce you to the process of using source control in [lesson zero](https://github.com/jedzej/tietopythontraining-basic/blob/master/SCOPE.md#lesson-0---the-setup).
Please follow the instructions carefully, to make our work easier.

For any questions or remarks, or any communication related to the
course use Slack at [tieto-comp-dev](https://tieto-comp-dev.slack.com/messages/).

### Rules of Engagement

1. For enrollment contact Marina (using Slack, of course),
1. We assume you want to learn. If you cheat, you cheat yourself,
1. The schedule:
    1. The course starts on February 13th 2018,
    1. Each week we will provide a final version of one lesson and
       a set of exercises. All future lessons are there, but are
       subject to change,
    1. You have two weeks since then to create a pull request with all
       the solutions,
    1. ...but it doesn't there, we expect most of the learning to
       happen during review process,
1. We highly recommend solving the exercise just after the lesson,
1. Don't hesitate to talk to us at Slack, ask questions, let us know,
   if something is unclear and don't take the reviews personally ;)

We hope you will have a lot of fun learning!
