"""
Write a function named collatz() that has one parameter named number.
If number is even, then collatz() should print number // 2 and return
this value. If number is odd, then collatz() should print and
return 3 * number + 1.

Then write a program that lets the user type in an integer and that
keeps calling collatz() on that number until the function returns
the value 1. (Amazingly enough, this sequence actually works
for any integer—sooner or later, using this sequence, you’ll
arrive at 1! Even mathematicians aren’t sure why. Your program
is exploring what’s called the Collatz sequence,
sometimes called “the simplest impossible math problem.”)

Remember to convert the return value from input()
to an integer with the int() function; otherwise,
it will be a string value.

Hint: An integer number is even if number % 2 == 0,
and it’s odd if number % 2 == 1.
