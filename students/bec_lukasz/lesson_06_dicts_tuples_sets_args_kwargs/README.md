1. [Snakify / Lesson 8 / Problems](https://snakify.org/lessons/functions/problems/) ("Uppercase" and "Reverse the sequence" only)
1. [Snakify / Lesson 10 / Problems](https://snakify.org/lessons/sets/problems/) ("Cubes", "The number of distinct words in some text" and "Guess the number" only)
1. [Snakify / Lesson 11 / Problems](https://snakify.org/lessons/dictionaries_dicts/problems/) ("Access rights", "Countries and cities" and "Frequency analysis" only)
1. Args sum - write a function called sum_all that takes any number of arguments and returns their sum.
1. Args inspector - write a function called inspect_args that prints passed args and kwargs in human-readable format.
1. Logger wrapper - write a function called logger_wrapper that wraps call to any function in order to log passed args.
The function must take `foo`, `*args` and `**kwargs`, prints `*args` and `**kwargs` in human readable format and finally call `foo` with args and kwargs
