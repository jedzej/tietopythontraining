# Statement
# In chess, the bishop moves diagonally, any number of squares.
# Given two different squares of the chessboard, determine whether
# a bishop can go from the first to the second in one move.
# The program receives as input four numbers from 1 to 8,
# specifying the column and row numbers of the starting square
# and the column and row numbers of the ending square.
# The program should output YES if a Bishop can go from the first square
# to the second in one move, or NO otherwise.
