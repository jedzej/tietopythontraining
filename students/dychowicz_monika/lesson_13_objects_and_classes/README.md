#### practice projects
1. [Think Python: How to Think Like a Computer Scientist / Chapter 15 / Exercise 1 ](http://greenteapress.com/thinkpython2/html/thinkpython2016.html)
1. Object inspector 1 - write a function that for a given object and list of attribute names returns dictionary with names and values of object's attributes.
1. Object inspector 2 - write a function that for a given object returns dictionary with names and values of all object's attributes that are instances of string, integer or float.
1. Selective shallow compare - write a function that for given 2 objects and list of attribute names checks if objects' attributes are equal.
