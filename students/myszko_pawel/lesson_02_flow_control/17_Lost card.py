# There was a set of cards with numbers from 1 to N. One of the card is now lost.
# Determine the number on that lost card given the numbers for the remaining cards.
# Given a number N, followed by N âˆ’ 1 integers - representing the numbers on the remaining cards (distinct integers in the range from 1 to N).
# Find and print the number on the lost card.

# Read an integer:
N = int(input())
lista_miss = []
# Print a value:
for i in range(1, N):
    a = int(input())
    lista_miss.append(a)
for i in range(1, N+1):
    if i not  in lista_miss:
        print(i)
