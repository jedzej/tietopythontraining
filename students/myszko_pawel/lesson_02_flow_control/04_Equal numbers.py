# Given three integers, determine how many of them are equal to each other.
# The program must print one of these numbers: 3 (if all are the same), 2 (if two of them are equal to each other and the third is different) or 0 (if all numbers are different).

# Read an integer:
a = int(input())
b = int(input())
c = int(input())
counter = 0
# Print a value:
if(a == b == c):
    counter = 3
elif((a == b) or (a == c) or (b == c)):
    counter = 2
print(counter)
